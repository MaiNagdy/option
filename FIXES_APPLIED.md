# ✅ All Issues Fixed!

## 🔧 Problems Fixed:

### 1. **CVC Bar Out of Window** ✅
**Problem:** CVC input field was overflowing outside the payment modal
**Fix:** Changed from `flex` to `grid grid-cols-2` layout for proper spacing
**Location:** `templates/profile.html` line 386

### 2. **Profile Settings Cannot Be Updated** ✅
**Problem:** Profile name field was read-only
**Fix:** 
- Removed `readonly` attribute from name input
- Added "Save Changes" button
- Created `/api/update-profile` endpoint
- Added JavaScript function `saveProfileSettings()`
**Locations:** 
- `templates/profile.html` lines 68-103
- `app.py` lines 369-398

### 3. **Subscription Reverts to Free After Refresh** ✅
**Problem:** Plan changes weren't persisted, reverted on page reload
**Fix:**
- Added `user_data.json` file persistence
- Created `load_user_data()` function to load data on startup
- Created `save_user_data()` function to save data on changes
- Added `save_user_data()` calls to all user update operations:
  - Signup
  - Profile update
  - Subscription upgrade
  - Subscription cancellation
**Locations:** `app.py` lines 60-88 and throughout

## 📊 User Data Persistence Flow:

```
1. Server starts → load_user_data() → users_db
2. User upgrades → users_db updated → save_user_data() → user_data.json
3. User refreshes → load_user_data() → users_db (with saved plan)
4. ✅ Plan persists!
```
